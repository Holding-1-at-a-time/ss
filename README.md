# Slick Solutions – AI​-Powered, Multi​-Tenant SaaS for Vehicle Inspection & Auto Detailing

**Slick Solutions** is a multi​-tenant, AI​-powered SaaS platform designed for modern auto detailing start-up businesses. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools for vehicle inspection, including VIN scanning, damage detection, intelligent pricing, scheduling, and reporting. The platform integrates seamlessly with Convex’s real-time backend, Ollama models, and semantic memory, providing a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution for vehicle inspection for auto detailing businesses By having their clients perform the assessment on their own vehicles which will: improve customer experience, and increase revenue. The application allows clients to perform self-assessments on their vehicles using their smartphones, generating estimates based on detailers' base price for services and utilizing AI dynamic pricing for services condition pricing models. The platform also supports scheduling and workflow automation, ensuring efficient operations and customer satisfaction.

## 🚘 Vehicle Intake & Inspection

- **VIN Scanning via Camera** — Uses vPIC API for real​-time decoding of vehicle specs (make, model, trim, engine, fuel type, body class).
- **Photo Guidance Overlay** — Framing hints and quality thresholds for clean captures.
- **Damage Detection Pipeline** — Powered by `llama3.2-vision`, detects dents, scratches, severity levels, and bounding boxes.
- **Filthiness Scoring** — AI​-based dirt segmentation informs cleaning labor and pricing.
- **VIN Pre​-Fill** — Auto​-populates vehicle details based on decoded VIN.

---

## 🧠 Semantic AI Integration

- **Inspection Embeddings** — Uses `mxbai-embed-large` to generate semantic vectors for each inspection.
- **Convex RAG Component** — Stores per​-chunk embeddings with indexable precision.
- **Convex Vector Search** — Tenant​-scoped similarity search for inspections and documentation retrieval.

---

## 💸 Dynamic Pricing Engine

- **Rule​-Based Pricing** — Based on VIN specs, damage severity, filthiness, and team size.
- **ML Predictions** — Predicts labor hours and recurrence risk from inspection vectors.
- **Custom Shop Settings** — Labor rate, surge multipliers, discount tiers, and skill markups.
- **Estimate Editor** — Interactive breakdown of costs (base, labor, discounts) with real​-time recalculation.
- **Transparent Pricing UI** — Exposes pricing factors and updates dynamically with modifier changes.

---

## 🗓️ Scheduling & Workflow Automation

- **Approval & Booking UI** — Calendar and time​-slot selection integrated post​estimate.
- **Load​-Aware Pricing** — Surge adjustments if occupancy exceeds thresholds.
- **Cron Integration** — Scheduled workflows for reminders, maintenance tasks, and reports.
- **Notification Pipeline** — Automatic SMS/email confirmations, reminders, and alerts.

---

## 🔍 Observability & Monitoring

- **Performance Alerts** — SLA breaches (e.g. embedding latency >500​ms, workflow failure >5%) escalate via Slack or PagerDuty.
- **Custom Metrics** — Track RAG success rate, throughput, model drift, and pricing variance.
- **Audit Logging** — Full trail of actions for compliance and troubleshooting.

---

## 📦 File & Data Management

- **Convex File Storage** — Media saved and attached via inspection and damage IDs.
- **Edge​-Linked Cleanup** — Automatically deletes orphaned files when the parent record is removed.
- **Damage​-Linked Photos** — Each damage instance is tied to a frame using bounding box metadata.

---

## 🧹 Multi​-Tenant Data Isolation & Schema Engineering

- **Shop​-Scoped Entities** — Every table includes explicit `shopId` for tenant isolation.
- **RAG Namespace Segmentation** — Enables embedding vectors and search per shop.
- **Filtering by Context** — Vector search filters by `shopId`, `referenceType`, severity, and date.
- **Advanced Schema Design**
  - Compound indexes to avoid full table scans.
  - Type​-safe schema validation deploy​-time via Convex Schema.
  - Safe field evolution with optional→required progression.

---

## ♻️ Workflow & Scheduling Power Extensions

- **Interval Definitions** — Flexible jobs for reminders or maintenance workflows.
- **Convex Workflows Engine** — Real​-time orchestration with retry logic.
- **Durable Cron Jobs** — Batch analytics, pricing reevaluation, and load management.

---

## 📸 Smart Damage Analysis

- **Vectorized Damage Storage** — Semantic embeddings per damage instance.
- **Similarity Matching** — Surface related inspections or recurring issues.
- **Bundled Offer Generation** — Combine recurring repair or cleaning services proactively.

---

## 🔍 Hybrid Vector + Keyword Search & Filtering (Advanced)

- **Dual Search Capability** — Semantic + structured filters (e.g. metadata category, severity, date).
- **Weighted Scoring** = `0.6 × vector_similarity + 0.3 × keyword_match + 0.1 × time_decay`.
- **Multi​-Namespace Filtering** — Search across categories (e.g. policies, manuals) by metadata.
- **Time​-Window Queries** — E.g., show similar inspections within past 90 days.
- **Dynamic UI** — Ranked results with live updates and smooth scroll interaction.

---

## 🔮 Prediction​-Based Pricing Triggers

- **Repair Complexity Forecasting** — Embedding​based predictions trigger adjustments in `dynamicEstimates`.
- **Demand​-Responsive Pricing** — Cron logic evaluates occupancy (e.g. >80%), applies `surgeMultiplier`.
- **Parts Availability Add​-Ons** — Inventory API flags low​stock items and adds surcharges.
- **Customer Tier Discounts/Penalties** — Loyalty programs or cancellation behavior modifies pricing.
- **Recurrence Prediction Offers** — Pre​paid or bundled services based on likelihood of return.
- **Weather​-Driven Pricing** — E.g., hail or high​temperature forecasts automatically adjust quotes.
